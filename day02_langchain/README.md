# Day 2 — LangChain Fundamentals

## What is LangChain?

LangChain is an open-source framework for building applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).

It provides modular components and end-to-end tools that help developers build complex AI systems such as:

* Chatbots
* RAG systems
* AI agents
* Knowledge assistants
* Workflow automation systems

---

## Why Do We Need LangChain?

When building LLM applications manually, we need to handle:

* User query processing
* Semantic search
* Document retrieval (PDF, database, etc.)
* Prompt construction
* Model interaction
* Output formatting

LangChain simplifies this entire pipeline by organizing everything into structured components and chains.

### Example Flow (RAG System)

User Query
→ Semantic Search
→ Retrieve Relevant Documents
→ Construct Prompt
→ Send to LLM
→ Return Final Output

LangChain manages these steps efficiently.

## Benefits of LangChain

1. Concept of chains (connect multiple steps)
2. Complete ecosystem for LLM app development
3. Memory and state handling
4. Model-agnostic development (works with multiple LLM providers)

## What Can You Build with LangChain?

* Conversational chatbots
* AI knowledge assistants
* AI agents
* Workflow automation systems
* Summarization tools
* Research helpers
