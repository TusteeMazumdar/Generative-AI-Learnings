# Day 1 — Introduction to Generative AI

## What is Generative AI?

Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content such as:

* text
* images
* music
* code

It learns patterns from existing data and generates new outputs that mimic human creativity.

## Applications

* Customer support chatbots
* Content creation
* Education tools
* Software development assistants

## Two Perspectives in Generative AI

### Builder Perspective

* Transformer architecture
* Pretraining
* RLHF
* Quantization
* Fine-tuning
* Model deployment

### User Perspective

* Prompt engineering
* RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
* AI agents
* Vector databases
* LLM APIs
* LangChain
* HuggingFace
* Ollama

## Career Roles

* Data Scientist → builds models
* Software Developer → builds applications
* AI Engineer → connects models with applications
